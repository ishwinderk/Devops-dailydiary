This allows users to customize and modify the OS according to their needs, giving them greater flexibility and control over the system.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">2.Stability and Reliability: </span>Linux is known for its stability and reliability, making it a preferred choice for servers and critical infrastructure. It has a robust memory management system and is less prone to crashes and system failures.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">3.Security:</span> Linux is designed with security in mind. It has a strong user permission model and regularly receives security updates and patches to address vulnerabilities promptly.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">4.Performance: </span>Linux typically has lower resource requirements compared to other operating systems, allowing it to run efficiently on various hardware configurations.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">5.Wide Range of Applications:</span> Linux is used in a wide range of applications, from web servers and cloud infrastructure to embedded systems and IoT devices.<br><br>In practice, Linux and Docker are often used together to take advantage of both technologies. Docker runs natively on Linux, and many Docker images are built on top of Linux-based distributions. Developers use Linux as the underlying operating system on servers, and then Docker containers are used to package and deploy applications and services in a consistent and reproducible manner.<br><br>By combining the stability, performance, and customizability of Linux with the portability, isolation, and scalability of Docker, developers can create a powerful and flexible infrastructure to deploy and manage applications effectively. Docker complements Linux, enabling efficient utilization of resources and simplifying the deployment and management of complex applications in various environments.<br><br>Linux Distribution :<br>- Ubuntu<br>- Debian<br>- Contos<br>- Alpine<br>- Kali (Ethical Hacking)<br><br>Commands for Linux (Ubuntu), Below are some commonly used commands:<br>1. open <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;color:#1155cc;"><a target="_blank" href="http://hub.docker.com/">hub.docker.com</a></span> - copy command and paste it in terminal(play-with-docker)<br>2. docker run -it ubuntu<br>3. echo &quot;name&quot; with root @id <br>4. history (history will be displayed)<br>5. ls (history of directories)<br>6. pwd (present working directory)<br>7. cd lib (change directory with new directory)<br>8. back to /; cd/(come backs to previous directory)<br>9. apt list (list of all packages)<br>10. apt list update<br>11. apt install yarn<br>12. exit <br><br>ubuntu - / <br>windows - \</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
