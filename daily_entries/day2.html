It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, keeping track of their individual contributions and merging them seamlessly.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Key concepts in Git:</span><br>Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.<br>It is used for:<br>Tracking code changes<br>Tracking who made changes<br>Coding collaboration.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Git tasks:</span><br>Manage projects with Repositories<br>Clone a project to work on a local copy<br>Control and track changes with Staging and Committing<br>Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project<br>Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy<br>Push local updates to the main project.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Working with Git</span><br>-Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository<br>-Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder<br>-When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified<br>-You select the modified files you want to Stage<br>-The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files<br>-Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.<br>-You can revert back to any previous commit.<br>-Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Github</span>- Git is not the same as GitHub.<br>GitHub makes tools that use Git.<br>GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Github Desktop-</span> GitHub Desktop is an application that enables you to interact with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. GitHub Desktop encourages you and your team to collaborate using best practices with Git and GitHub. You can use GitHub Desktop to complete most Git commands from your desktop with visual confirmation of changes. You can push to, pull from, and clone remote repositories with GitHub Desktop, and use collaborative tools such as attributing commits and creating pull requests.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Gitlab-</span> GitLab is a web-based Git repository that provides free open and private repositories, issue-following capabilities, and wikis. It is a complete DevOps platform that enables professionals to perform all the tasks in a projectâ€”from project planning and source code management to monitoring and security. Additionally, it allows teams to collaborate and build better software.<br>GitLab helps teams reduce product lifecycles and increase productivity, which in turn creates value for customers. The application doesn&#39;t require users to manage authorizations for each tool. If permissions are set once, then everyone in the organization has access to every component.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Pipeline-</span> Git Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for modeling build, testing and deploying code. All jobs in a stage are executed simultaneously and, if it succeeds, the pipeline moves on to the next stage. If one of the jobs fails, as a rule, the next stage is not executed.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Steps followed for using shared github repository:</span><br>1. Install github Desktop and login with your credentials <br>2. Fork the parent repository<br>3. Clone that particular repository on the local system(this will show that particular repository in your system at your desired location)<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Task-</span> write html code and push that into github repository . generate pull request. Then finally fetch the code files of other team members into your own repository.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Steps followed to complete this task are: <br></span>1. write html code on vs code in the same folder as of github<br>2. In github desktop after creating html code then click commit to main then click push origin<br>3. now open github account on web<br>i. now generate pull request by clicking on pull request<br>ii. create new pull request<br>iii. add comments and create new pull request<br>4. After the pull request had been accepted , merged file will be shown <br>5. Next step is to fetch this data, in doing so click go to github desktop <br>6. click on Fetch Origin, after it got completed <br>7. goto Branch , then click Merge into current branch  <br>This will fetch all the data into your current repository</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
